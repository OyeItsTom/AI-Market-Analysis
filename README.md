# AI Market Analysis

An educational, evidence-driven quantitative market-research and
**paper-trading** platform.

> **This system does not execute real-money trades.** It is a research and
> learning project. Nothing in it is investment advice, and no part of it is
> production-ready.

## Status

**Phase 1 — Market Data Foundation: implemented.**
**Phase 2 — Research data semantics + feature engine: implemented.**

Later phases (strategies, backtesting, evaluation, risk, signals, paper
trading, dashboard) are not implemented yet.

## Target architecture

```
Market Data  →  Validation  →  Normalized OHLCV  →  Feature Engine
     →  Strategy Engines  →  Backtesting  →  Evaluation
     →  Risk Engine  →  Signal Engine  →  Paper Trading  →  Dashboard
```

Phase 1 covers the first three boxes.

## What exists today

```
src/data/
├── models.py            MarketBar, Interval — the canonical OHLCV record
├── provider.py          MarketDataProvider abstract base + error types
├── normalization.py     vendor records → MarketBar
├── validation.py        per-bar and per-series validation rules
├── storage.py           CsvBarStore — local CSV cache under data/raw/
├── series.py            BarSeries + PriceBasis — the safe research unit
├── corporate_actions.py splits and cash dividends
├── adjustment.py        explicit raw → adjusted transform
├── sessions.py          gap contract (exchange calendar DEFERRED)
└── providers/
    ├── yahoo.py         yfinance adapter (development / fallback source)
    └── alpaca.py        architectural stub

src/features/            pure feature functions over BarSeries
├── base.py              FeatureSeries, warm-up and timing semantics
├── returns.py           simple and log returns

### The core idea

Strategies, backtests and risk code depend on `MarketBar` and
`MarketDataProvider` — never on a vendor SDK. A vendor's column names,
timezone quirks and error types stop at its adapter. Swapping Yahoo for
Alpaca, or replaying a stored dataset, changes one class and nothing else.

## Quick start

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -q
```

```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone

from src.data import CsvBarStore, Interval, SeriesKey
from src.data.providers import YahooFinanceProvider

provider = YahooFinanceProvider()
bars = provider.get_bars(
    "AAPL",
    datetime(2024, 1, 1, tzinfo=timezone.utc),
    datetime(2024, 3, 1, tzinfo=timezone.utc),
    Interval.DAY_1,
)

store = CsvBarStore()
store.write(bars)  # only settled bars; pass include_unsettled=True for the forming one
cached = store.read(SeriesKey("AAPL", Interval.DAY_1, "yfinance"))
```

## Data sources

| Provider | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Yahoo (`yfinance`) | working | Development / fallback only. Unofficial endpoint, delayed, rate-limited, short intraday history. **Raw/unadjusted prices — corporate actions are not modelled, so a split looks like an extreme return.** Not market-grade. |
| Alpaca | stub | Interface only. Needs `alpaca-py` and **paper-trading** credentials from the environment. See `docs/market_data.md`. |

## Configuration and secrets

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your own values. `.env` is
git-ignored; API keys never belong in code, in logs or in commits. Phase 1
needs no credentials at all.

Downloaded market data lives in `data/raw/` and `data/processed/`, both
git-ignored — datasets are never committed.

## Testing

```bash
pytest -q
```

The suite runs entirely offline: provider tests inject fake responses and
storage tests use temporary directories.

## Not implemented (by design, for later phases)

Trading strategies, buy/sell recommendations, ML/AI prediction, LLM or news
analysis, portfolio optimization, position sizing, dashboard UI, and any form
of broker order execution — including live-money trading.

The Phase 2 feature engine computes indicators as *research inputs*. It
produces no signals and makes no predictions.
